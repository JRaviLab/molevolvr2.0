# MolEvolvR Backend

The backend is implemented as a RESTful API. TBC: More details about the API design.

## Usage

Run the `launch_api.sh` script to start API server in a hot-reloading development mode.
The server will run on port 8000, unless the env var `API_PORT` is set to another
value. Once it's running, you can access it at http://localhost:8000.
