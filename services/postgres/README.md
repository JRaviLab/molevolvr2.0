# PostgreSQL Configuration

This folder will eventually contain configuration for the PostgreSQL instance
that runs within the MolEvolvR stack.

The instance is responsible for:
- keeping records of analysis submissions
- tracking job status between the backend and SLURM controller
- recording any artifacts that aren't better stored on the filesystem.
